# Tic Tac Toe Game in C

## Introduction

Hello everyone! This is a mini project I created while learning the C programming language. It’s a simple Tic Tac Toe game where two users play against each other.

## Prerequisites

To play this game, you need to have **SDL2 (Simple DirectMedia Layer)** and **Wayland** (a display server protocol) installed on your system.

- You can download SDL2 from the [official SDL2 website](https://www.libsdl.org/).
- You can download Wayland from the [official Wayland website](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/).

## Installation Instructions

### For Linux

You can install SDL2 and Wayland using the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libsdl2-dev
sudo apt install wayland
sudo apt install libwayland-dev
```

### For Windows

1. Clone the vcpkg repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg.git
   cd vcpkg
   .\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
   ```

2. Install SDL2 and SDL2_ttf using the following commands in the vcpkg terminal:

   ```bash
   vcpkg install sdl2
   vcpkg install sdl2-ttf
   ```

## Verifying the Installation

After installation, you can verify that SDL2 and SDL2_ttf are installed correctly by running:

```bash
sdl2-config --version
```

## How to Play

1. Compile the code using the following command:
   ```bash
   gcc -o tic_tac_toe main.c `sdl2-config --cflags --libs` -lSDL2_ttf
   ```

2. Run the game:
   ```bash
   ./tic_tac_toe
   ```

3. Players take turns placing their marks (X or O) on the 3x3 grid. The first player to get three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.

4. If all nine squares are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive user interface
- Two-player mode
- Reset functionality to restart the game

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure that SDL2 and Wayland are installed correctly.
- If you encounter any issues, check for errors in the terminal and make sure all dependencies are installed.
